[Task 2: News Expert](../tasks/news-agent.md)

## Troubleshooting reference

| Symptom | Check and next action |
|---|---|
| `opensearch-single` does not resolve | Confirm the command runs inside `lab` on the existing Compose network. |
| News index is missing or empty | Verify the supplied preloaded OpenSearch image and configured index; inspect startup logs. Do not overwrite the dataset. |
| Historical results are irrelevant | Inspect corpus coverage and query wording, then confirm embedding-model compatibility. A nearest neighbor is not necessarily useful evidence. |
| Server health passes but a question fails | Health reports server/configuration state; use the separate retrieval probes and Terminal B's error logs. |
| Port 8765 or 9001 is already in use | Check the existing foreground terminals. Reuse or stop the earlier process instead of launching another copy. |
| Tavily key remains "missing" after an export | Put the export in the MCP server's shell and restart that process; sibling shells retain their own environments. |
| Provider rejects credentials, parameters, or token budget | Revisit Task 1's validated provider profile. Avoid unreviewed dependency upgrades or disabling governance checks. |
| A2A card validation fails | Use `http://127.0.0.1:9001`, not an empty URL or the MCP endpoint. Check the advertised JSON-RPC protocol `1.0` interface. |
| An answer is withheld | Read the audit's attempt-level verification issues. A transport success is not proof of an approved application answer. |
| No audit file appears | Direct retrieval probes do not create request audits. After a full expert request, check the configured audit path, permissions, disk space, and server logs. |
| A sample-ingestion or test command is missing files | This task does not require either. The supplied archive has no CSV data directory or test suite; do not assume a path or Make target from another document is present. |
